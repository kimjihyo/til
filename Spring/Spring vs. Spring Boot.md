## Spring


The Spring framework is a Java-based web framework. 


The key features of Spring:

- Dependency Injection (DI)
- Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), which is a programming technique that separates concerns into reusable modules.

It’s packed with out of the box modules like 

- Spring JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
- Spring MVC
- Spring Security
- Spring AOP
- Spring ORM
- Spring Test

When using traditional Spring MVC (without Spring Boot), typically build a WAR file and deploy it to an external web application server like: Apache Tomcat, Jetty, or WildFly.


## Spring Boot


Spring Boot is a project built on top of the core Spring Framework that aims to simplify the development of Spring-based applications.

- Eliminates boilerplate configuration
- Embedding web application servers (like Tomcat) so don’t need to deploy to an external one.
